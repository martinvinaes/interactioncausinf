#Statistical Control in Multiplicative Interaction Models

*Jens Olav Dahlgaard and Martin Vin√¶s Larsen*

Linear regression models with multiplicative interaction terms are commonly used in both experimental and observational political science research to explore effect heterogeneity and test conditional causal theories. In this paper, we explore if adding control variables to a model with an interaction term effectively holds constant the variation in the interacted variables or if the estimated interaction effect can be confounded by the controls included in the model. We begin with an experimental template and demonstrate that if, for instance, one wants to examine how the effect of an experimental treatment in a survey experiment varies with education level, and include a linear control for age in the interaction model, the model will *not* give an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects across levels of education holding age constant. We demonstrate that this simple conclusion has important implications for how one can interpret a wide-range of observational, empirical applications of models where multiplicative interaction terms are used, such as unit fixed effects models in Time Series Cross Sectional data besides moderation analysis of experimental data.

This is an important conclusion, because it upends conventional wisdom about how to interpret statistical control in linear models with interaction terms. We survey recent research in the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, and the Journal of Politics to see if existing work routinely misunderstands how statistical control works in models with a multiplicative interaction term. We end the paper by giving some recommendations for how to draw appropriate inferences when using statisical control in models with an interaction term.
