#Causal Inference in Multiplicative Interaction Models

Used to explore effect heterogeneity and test conditional causal theories, linear regression models with multiplicative interaction terms are common in both experimental and observational political science research. In this paper, we show that when adding controls to a model with an interaction term, these do not effectively `hold constant' the two interacted variables. Instead, the estimated interaction effect can still be confounded by the included control. If, for instance, one wants to examine how the effect of an experimental treatment varies with level of education, and include a control for age in the interaction model, we show that the model will *not* be able to give you an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects across levels of education holding age constant.

We demomstrate that this has important implications for how we interpret a wide-range of empirical applications of the multiplicative interaction models, such as fixed effects models in Time Series Cross Sectional data and experimental data.
